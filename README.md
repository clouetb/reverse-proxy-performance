# reverse-proxy-performance
An attempt to build a Vagrant based analytics solution for http reverse proxies.

This repository aims at building a toolchain for the analysis of httpd access_log based upon :
- Kafka
- Druid
- Superset

A simple Flask based webapp with an Nginx reverse-proxy is built to enable data generation.
